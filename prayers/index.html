(Genesis 2:17)., Even after God warning them they didn't listen and fell into sin and they disobeyed God and became far from him but still God through his mercy didn't let Adam or Eve die but as they went far from God as a merciful father........

We all know that Jesus by his blood that he shed paid the price for our sins
and it also says in the scripture
it says that "you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body." (1 Corinthians 6:20). We are all the descendants of Jacob the one whom God chose and so his tribe became numerous.</p>

"Mercy" a very valuable and a Great virtue That we Learn From God,

God Has many Good Virtues,

But "Mercy" Is One of the Greatest virtue's that God has shown Us by which he saved us and sent his son as a Sacrifice for our sins

You see In The Days Before Our Lord Came on this earth,

people used to offer something at the altar of the Lord,

and whenever a family member has sinned and committed something great against the Lord,

The head or any person Of That family would offer a Sin Offering on the altar of The Lord,

Even at the time of Moses and Aaron,

God Told Them To offer A one year old male lamb as a sin offering to the Lord,

as it is written in the verse below,

<em>"The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats." (Exodus 12:5).</em>

This was done on the time of the passover, where God moved In Egypt and struck every first born of the egyptians,

You see God had mercy on us,

And our deeds were continuously going grave against him,

And So That we may too not end up being destroyed by the wrath of God,

God sent his Most Beloved Son Jesus as an sin offering and as a ransom for us,

His blood that was shed for us on the cross purchased for us eternal life and protected us from the judgement from, the law and from the wrath of God,

You see all whatever God did for us above [Sending Jesus on earth as a sacrifice for our sins] He did it because he had mercy on us !!!

Say it in your heart

<b>"God Sent Jesus Christ as an Eternal sacrifice, For my sins Because God had mercy on me"</b> 

You see this great virtue of mercy which God showed towards us was the greatest thing in all times because God sacrificed his only Beloved son in order to save human race from being destroyed and erased because of sin,

you see it even says in Romans 5:7

<em>"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die." (Romans 5:7).</em>

You see in both the sentences in the verse above it speaks about people who may die for a righteous and also for the Good,

But do you notice something,

the verse never mentioned who will die for the sinners ! 

You see to save a good man people will put their lives at stake,

but for the people who are sinners,

no one would ever think of putting their lives at stake,

But You see Jesus is the only person in the whole bible,

who died for us sinners,

we who had no one to die for us to protect us,

There God thought of us and he sent His Beloved Son To Die for us,

it says it all in the verses below,

<em>"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8).</em>

<em>"Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him." (Romans 5:9).</em>

<em>"For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life." (Romans 5:10).</em>

<em>"And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation." (Romans 5:11).</em>

And Bible says that we are too called to be the children of God in the verses below,

<em>"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God," (Romans 8:16).</em> And therefore God also expects us to show Mercy as he has shown mercy towards us and

to ask forgiveness when we have done wrong and also,

directed us to apply this virtue in our Life and In Our Nature,

You see as we are the Children Of God we need to follow God and all the things he does,

You see a child will always learn from his parents,

and will also adapt to their nature,

So much that he/she may even do somethings same as His/her parents usually do it.

We as children of God must adopt all the good qualities that God has in him,

after all we are his children,

we need to show mercy to one another and forgive each others

iniquities Just as God forgave us,

You see forgiveness is always connected to the peace and happiness in your life,

The moment you have not forgiven someone,

You will always have a voice bubbling in your heart against that person,

in the words

"He/she is a nut, he/she never understands things",

As this voice starts bubbling you develop hatred and anger against that person,

So much so that you even think of plotting or Like something in your heart as a curse bubbles up,

saying something very bad should happen to that person,

and when you do this, suddenly after sometime you find yourself in an bad situation and then some people there speak against God and say I asked for him/her,

But why did you do it to me,

You see the answer is ,

God did not do anything,

But when you thought to do something bad or even thought something bad of the person,

You have opened the door for strife to enter your life and create confusion and restlessness in your life,

You see why does God say forgive,

because of this same thing and even tells us not to speak bad about anyone,

These are the spiritual reasons which you should know.

Therefore refrain from speaking bad about anyone or even about your ownself for this will create strife to rise against you,

People speak what not against God,

and then even when they speak against God,

they make God's anger rise against them and therefore you yourself are responsible for the things that happen to you,

You Just ask what you wanted and have asked God to provide your every need but have you ever asked God what He needs from you ?,

God doesn't need your money,

God himself has given you that and not only that but your every Need right from the very first cloth and food for your body from the childhood till the time when you grow old and end up lying in the coffin ,

God provides it have you ever asked God what did he want from you?,

The answer Is He just needs you to walk according to his word and in his will in humbleness and willingness,

For His word and will is only for our good and not for any of his personal gains.

What will God get from you when you follow what he says?

Nothing. 

But instead he gives us many things as we obey his word and will,

You see Your obedience to God's word holds healing and deliverance and not only this but even blessings for life long.

The verse below very well shows what happens when we listen to God,

<em>"The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed." (Matthew 8:8).</em>

He Just belived and see What Jesus Replied,

<em>"Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you." And his servant was healed that same hour." (Matthew 8:13).</em>

You see as The Centurion Heard and Did what Jesus said His servant was healed at that very moment,

Do you now understand why God's will is important in our life !!!,

This is the power Of God and this is what you get in return of obeying his voice,

But you never serve God to just recive and to stay blessed,

But Indeed you need to Love God first and thirst and hunger for Him, and when you have God first and the world second or 3rd then only will you be worthy of all what he gives you,

You Need to keep God first in every aspect of your life, you need to hunger for his presence in your life and you need to know and confess that without God there is nothing in life,

He is the Air which we breathe,

He is the Beat Of Our heart,

He is the Blood that flows through our veins,

We are made in His image and therefore we are Very very Holy,

But the sin of the world made us turn away from God and because of sin we lose our holiness,

But God is holy and therefore he wants to make you holy again,

He wants you to turn to him,

for he wants to save you from sin that brings death,

You see my brothers and sisters,

God is our true Father who loves us and his love is true for he everytime tries to help and remove us from sin.

But we humans have not yet understood the fact that sin brings death,

I will give you an example of how does devil use sin to destroy and to kill God's people,

You see any person in sin,

remains in the hangover of it,

and never tries to come out of it,

for when he is in sin he is made blind by the devil and is shown certain fake things which he/she thinks to be true but the reality is the devil is making a fool of these people the devil is just playing around with their hearts and minds of these people who are in sin,

Like for an example the devil makes them to consume drugs, or fall into any other temptation and a bad habit,

and when they are in it,

they will just feel good in the hangover of sin [which is temporary] and then the devil makes them more crazy for it making them believe that these things what they do gives them peace,

But in reality the devil is giving them wounds on their hearts and each time these people are in the hangover of sin they hurt many people and themselves because of the words and the deeds that come out of their hearts.

Say if the person who is an addict to sinful habits Is once or twice spotted by His own people [like Mom/Dad or any other close member] and when their loved ones corrects or shouts on them because of their wrong habits the addict is given wounds by the devil on his/her heart and then these people who are addicted blast out saying or doing some actions which actually even leave the loved one hurted with a wound in the heart and the wound which was previously given by the devil to the person who is addicted grows even more deeper and therefore at the end of the day these people who are addicted have a very deep cut (wound) in their heart,

and the devil will continue to do so each day,

till the heart of the addict is hurt in such a way that the heart spiritually collapses and has no hope left in it,

and this causes him/her to think  that they are completly alone in this world and feel hurt and then the devil will throw his final weapon that is a thought of suicide,

which will try to impact a person's mind in such a way that he/she will be convinced to to it,

You see this is the way the devil tries to end up many lives,

If He/she Just does one thing at that moment that is Cry out to The name of Jesus,

they will live to glorify God   

for as You call unto the name of Jesus,

Deliverance will begin to flow in your body,

For he is our God who delivers us,

as it even says in Romans,

<em>"That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord", and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9).</em> 

<em>"For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved." (Romans 10:10).</em>

no one calls unto the name of the Lord without Trusting in it,

But all who call to his name believe that he is Lord and God raised him up from the dead.

God saves them,

for as it is also written below,

<em>"As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame"." (Romans 10:11).,</em>

This is the promise of the Lord,

and till today it has never happened nor will it ever be that who has put his trust in the lord shall ever fail,

For God is true to his promises and what he says he does it.

My Life was too saved like this,

I was too on the path of sin and the devil wanted to destroy me the same way,

I was shown a vision by the devil in which I saw my self jumping of the school building where I studied and I also had seen my parents crying bitterly because of my death, I seen the police coming to investigate the incident at my house,

I was totally devastated I did not know what to do,

I really did not understand what to do,

I Just Cried out To God 

As I cried out "Lord Jesus Save Me!!!"   

God came the very next moment to rescue me and he put his right hand over my head and it was also over my face said son don't worry I will not let you die as God said these words to me my soul bursted with Joy and I was delivered from my fear and depression ,

Today all what I am it's all because of the Grace of God,

I was no one but God lifted me up,

I thank God For Saving Me and Using me for His Glory,

Today if you are too in sin and 

you too are shown these thoughts by the devil don't,

worry Just Call unto his name with a Belief in your heart That He our is Lord and saviour and believe that God raised Jesus From The death. 

God will also Come to you today and save you,

For the Lord loves you and he won't forsake you,

Just as he said In Isaiah 49,

<em>"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!" (Isaiah 49:15).</em>

God has not forgotten you, He will save you,

<br>Believe in God !!!

<br>Believe in this message !!!

<br>And You will be delivered !!!

<br>Shalom !!! Shalom !!!

<br>God Bless You !!!<br>

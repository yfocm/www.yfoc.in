    <p class="blog-post_text">You see the devil always tries to bring accusation against God's Children (that is us), But Jesus and The holy spirit defend and protect us, Jesus Christ died on the Cross for our sins and covered us under his blood that Cried out mercy for us to God, In The words "Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing". And they divided up his clothes by casting lots." (Luke 23:34).

    <p class="blog-post_text"> In The Book Of Jeremiah writes, "I know, O LORD, that a man's life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps." (Jeremiah 10:23). You see many people only take their decisions to be right, and they work on it without enquiring God about their plans. And sometimes because of this they even fall into sin with these self decisions that they take, Now Let me give you an example, say a person who sees his colleague smoking and when he was persuaded by him he too starts to smoke now, not enquiring or seeking God's opinion and correction, Now I have said this not to condemn somebody, But to give you and example of the situations and times in which we need to ask God, odd will correct you, but still you need to bear his correction,you see God can make you forcefully do the good things, and then you will never fall into sin.

    <p class="blog-post_text">God gave me this word today from the book of Judges, As we are fasting and praying, God showed me that he is doing something about this plague and That as the bread of Gideon said in the verse below struck the camps of the midianites who were oppressing Israel and blew them up, "Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream", he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed"." (Judges 7:13). "His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands"." (Judges 7:14).

    <p class="blog-post_text">Jesus said "I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture." (John 10:9). Therefore in these times as we are facing so much troubles, Let us enter the Gate that is Jesus by surrendering and offering your life To Him, if you were a sinner till now it is ok repent for your sins, You still have time surrender your life to God, if you have a doubt that Would God Accept You?, I tell you YES!!! That God will accept you !!!, Because he loves you and says "to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!' "They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill." (Isaiah 49:9). Those in Captivity to sin and are in the darkness of sin,he says when you come to God and confess that you had sinned and now want to follow God

We sing and shout our praises to God through Jesus, the Messiah! " (Romans 5:11). You see the above verse shows us how we worship and praise God and have faith in him. Many times we have noticed people Just praying Godd Give Me This" "God Give Me That" and what not but they will never praise God or even if they praise they say it on a very dry day. Tell yourself "God does not hear to your dry praises" These praises are just said to flatter God. But God is your father So you can't fool him. He knows when you are truly worshiping and praising him and when you just do it for name sak....

We see there was also an giant in the times of David, and that giant was a real trouble to the Israelites, we see in the verses below how the giant used to hurl insults at The Ranks of the Israelites and against Our Living God as David himself said this in the verse below "Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, Whom you have defied."

In today's world rebellion has become the most common emotion that many people carry within their heart for each other. This rebellion spirit has made people not believe in each other. So much so that they even lose faith in God. Now let me explain how they lose faith in God. The people who lose faith in God are not the people who don't know God but, they are the people who once served and prayed to God but once when something wrong happened, they just stopped serving God. Now the question arises what made them lose faith in God and stop serving God? The answer is.........

(Genesis 2:17)., Even after God warning them they didn't listen and fell into sin and they disobeyed God and became far from him but still God through his mercy didn't let Adam or Eve die but as they went far from God as a merciful father........

We all know that Jesus by his blood that he shed paid the price for our sins
and it also says in the scripture
